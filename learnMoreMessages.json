  "Quickly continue from where you left off. Open up your reports in ReportMilla and start fleshing out your report. Use shortcuts to drop commonly used paragraphs or legislation right into your reports",
  "All done? With your client eagerly awaiting, why not send them a PDF or shareable link so they can view their report instantly? Not only are you saving on labour and paper costs, but you're also beating out the competition on time-to-delivery, increasing customer satisfaction and improving your image",
  "We all know survey report writing shouldn't be the time, money and energy burden it currently is.",
